Recently, a certain Marcus Frame infiltrated my playlist. The first song I listened to, or perhaps the one that found me was ‘More Bass’. His Glasgow accent drew me in completely. He was rapping, and you could feel he was at home. From there, I started to slowly sketch the mystery of the Scottish singer-rapper-composer : spoken rap, upholstered with warm and fast jazz. In the song, he asks: “Do I need more bass, do I need more treble?”, and I imagine he has the answer, since one can't help but be struck by his musical proximity to Loyle Carner, the now accomplished artist from South London who burst onto the rap scene with the same languid, melancholic rap and jazz that propelled him to fame with Yesterday's Gone. I dived in and listened to ‘20s plenty’, a hymn to slowness, punctuated by injunctions such as “she don't care how you feel,” “I just wanna take my time,” and fabulous piano flights. Okay Marcus, you’re good. 
Continuously and thoroughly researching the rest of his music, I came across ‘Zip’, his latest track, fresh off the press at the time! Imagine my surprise when I found myself in medias res, inside a drum-n-bass track, his rapped and sung phrases rising and falling in lockstep with the beat’s drops.The track made me giggle as he played around with different accents and practically vomited out the ends of his sentences. This sudden change fueled the mystery of Marcus Frame once again, who has no albums published on streaming platforms. No EPs either. Five hits and a few collaborations: I learn that he’s among those with fewer than 1,000 monthly listeners. Online, his Mexican alias, Marcus Frame, complicates the search for additional information about him. The enigma continues on B4 CHANGE, where Marcus Frame sings and composes a track straight out of the Parcels universe. 
So my question is: Who is Marcus Frame? We want to find out, and we're keeping our fingers crossed that they can better channel this sprawling sound and influences into one
