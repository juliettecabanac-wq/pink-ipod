    I can’t remember how, but recently, a certain Marcus Frame has infiltrated my playlist. This first mystery, “How did he get there?”, will lead to many others. 
His music reached me with a mystical appearance : he arrived in my ears with “more bass”. You could feel he was at home; rather even I was at home with him. Yes, I was, it was his Glasgow accent which brought me with him, interlaced in this spoken rap, and he ushered me with a warm and fast jazz. In the song he asks :  “Do I need more bass, do I need more treble?”, and I imagine he has the answer, since one can't help but be struck by his musical proximity to Loyle Carner, the now accomplished artist from South London who burst onto the rap scene with the same languid, melancholic rap and jazz that propelled him to fame with Yesterday's Gone. This first listen gives me a clear answer: Marcus is undoubtedly the worthy heir to Loyle Carner, with his sharp but nonchalant rap style descending from Joey BadaSS, and his layered atmosphere in the likes of Lauryn Hill. Needing to quench this new thirst called Marcus Frame, I dived in and listen to 20s plenty, a hymn to slowness, a landscape usually punctuated by injunctions such as “she don't care how you feel”, “I just wanna take my time”, and fabulous piano flights. I clinged to this Scottish “mayday” and let it happen. As I devoured the rest of his music, I came across Zip, his latest track, fresh off the press. Imagine my surprise when I found myself in media res in a techno track, punctuated by his speech imitating synthetic drops. It's almost laughable when he plays around with different accents and practically vomits out the ends of his sentences. This sudden change fueled the mystery of Marcus Bass once again, who has no albums published on streaming platforms. No EPs either. Five hits and a few collaborations: I learn that this famous Marcus Frame is among those with fewer than 1,000 monthly listeners. Online, his Mexican alias, Marcus Frame complicates the search for additional information about him. The enigma continues on B4 CHANGE, where Marcus Frame sings and composes a track straight out of the Parcels universe. 
So my question is: Who is Marcus Frame? We want to find out, and we're keeping our fingers crossed that they can combine this sprawling sound to escape its (perceived) references.
