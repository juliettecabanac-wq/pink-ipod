  <h1 class="title-article">WANTED: Who is Marcus Frame ?</h1>
  <div class="article-columns">
  <p class="paragraph-art">
Okay, I might actually be a stalker now ? Or a concerning fan girl ? Some might romantically call it manifestation. However creepy or weird, I am very happy. I found Marcus Frame.

So, to refresh your memory, Marcus Frame had infiltrated my pink ipod. I wrote an article about it, the whole ordeal, wondering who this artist was and what he would do next. Anyway, this is a rather long way of saying I got to interview Marcus Frame.
In my clumsy ways, I, of course : 
1) Gave a non-uk time to a Scottish artist 
2) Sent him an email to say I had been waiting on the link 
3) Sent him another email to apologize because I had gotten the time wrong. 

Off to a great start!!

My first impression was that Marcus Frame is more quiet than I thought. The assumption was certainly misplaced, considering his laid-back / observer’s writing, I could have expected it. Maybe I was surprised he was sitting so straight. His voice was instantly recognizable.

A couple things I learnt from this interview : Marcus Frame is aware of his Marcus Frame Spanish doppëlganger (no plans of destitution - yet). I say “like” way too much. He is going to make music under a different secret alias. He used to have a band but his mate got deported from England back to the US after uni (how contemporary). He’s currently making an album, which might include some French. He’s definitely a great artist, and maybe scared of getting old or missing out, so he’s giving us all of it. 

“The music's just like a little extension of myself. It's nothing too serious”.

This is my hour with Marcus Frame : 

Pink Ipod: What was the first song you’ve ever written ? A silly one perhaps ?
Marcus Frame: There’s probably many silly songs I’ve written, from a young age. I have played guitar for quite a while, since I was a tod [toddler]. I think my first song was an apology for not tidying my room. Based on “Price Tag” by Jessie J. 

Unfortunately, I can only give a written description of the masterpiece : 
Mommy Mommy Mommy
Can you just forgive me give me give me
I’m only huuuuman
And humans make mistaaaakes

It worked, his mom forgave him.

PI: Obviously this song was the sign you were going to become a great artist. How did you start making music “more seriously” ? 
MF: I got out of the house, and started making music when I possibly could. I moved out into a west area of town, and tried to socialize and network with a lot of musicians and creatives. Mostly, I’m trying to figure everything out as we speak. I can’t say that I have reached a state I’m completely happy with.

PI: As you just said, you're figuring things out right now. There's just a lot of different genres that you've been exploring : rap, spoken word, and more funky music. And then you have a drum and bass song, “Zip”. I was wondering, is there a genre that you have preferred so far? Do you want to mix all of them? Where do you see the future of your projects between these different explorations?
MF: It's funny you say that, because the first track I've ever made and produced was a tech house track. I was into DJing at the time, I followed the likes of Michael Beebe and Pawsa and tried to make a tech house track based on that, called “Potluck”. It was underneath an alias that I made for myself. So ideally I'd like to move back into producing music underneath a different alias. Just so not everybody... So I can make some stuff for my own name and then one for a separate name. 

PI: What would you produce under that alias? What do you feel like you don't want to put under the current Marcus frame persona? 
MF: I would use it so I could just be more myself and just make random things like that ‘zip’, for instance.. Just be myself and make random beats, sing in different accents, wear sunglasses. Just so that not everybody relates all my artwork to myself. So I can keep a barrier between myself and what I'm making. Because what you make is not necessarily yourself, you know what I mean? 

PI: I had a question about that because when I was listening to a couple of your songs, it felt like your writing was very much from an observer's perspective, with a sort of nonchalance, kind of spectating the world as it is. Do you feel like your writing is close to who you are ? Or is it a persona, a character you’re playing ?
MF: It's funny you say that, that I'm making fun of life and things like that. I've always got a thought about time and how you don't get much time. You're only young once, you're only getting older. So I think a lot of my writing tends to fall around that sort of theme. Just about life in general, how I think of it. I don't really think about it too much, I don't think about themes or anything like that. I just kind of write and then hopefully it sounds okay with music behind it. 

Here, I got a bit skeptical, I’ll be honest. I get skeptical of all artists who tell me they don’t think about it that much; I understand it though. It just flows through them, it gets ejected. 

MF: I'll only write when something's happened to me, like a heartbreak or just life. If I'm bored or if I've got things that I'm going through personally in life, I'll just write something down about it and it ends up just falling into some sort of track. 

PI: So you write before you compose? 
MF:  Yeah, write before I compose mostly. 

PI:  And which came first, writing or musical practice ?
MF: I would say music started first. I've always played guitar, bass. The writing has just been a new thing as I've grown and seen the world. I've just wanted to go and look into the world through words.

PI: You said you used to DJ, what kind of tracks were you interested in mixing with? 
MF: I love old school disco house. Kind of techno, kind of just stuff that makes people want to groove and actually dance, instead of just standing there with a drink. 

PI: And in terms of your musical influences, what did you grow up around, is there a particular artist or genre that you feel has marked you ?
MF: Yeah, Tom Misch. Or, can I go back to Jordan Rakey, Stevie Wonder. Going way back. Phil Lyna, The Jam, Paul Weller, all these kinds of people. But the Tom Misch kind of sound, that's the kind of thing that I quite like to try and imitate, and some of my influences came from that. 

PI: Okay, maybe I can ask you something a bit more, like... Material, I guess. Do you make music full-time? 
MF: No, no. 

PI: Okay, then what do you do on the side and how do you try to reconcile the material obligations with your music ? 
MF: Well, currently I'm in college. So I've just been studying and making music on the side. Music, studying, working, music, study, work. And I've got a new job as well now. Working in sales. 

PI: I guess if you have a job now, it's... How is it for you to make music? Like, do you still find the time? 
I still find the time, yeah. I've made my best stuff off the back of a close (meaning at the end of a shift. Took me a while to figure that one out). Four o'clock in the morning, bar work. It's hard to force making music full-time. It doesn't necessarily pay too many. Unless you're doing it, obviously, 100%, which is the goal over the next couple of months. I'm working on a wee album just now. 

Hihihihihiiiii that was cool to hear !

PI: Can I ask what is going to be the concept for the album?
MF: There's going to be a few tracks similar to the “more bass”, a few spoken word pieces and then almost the bridge to the alias. And then there'll be a new album based on the alias.

PI: You mentioned a bit earlier that you kind of started getting into music when you got around other creatives and musicians. I saw that you did this residency at Anam Creative, can you explain to me what that was ?
MF: They commission individual artists to make certain types of music. There's basically two guys that run the company, they source lots of different underrepresented artists who have potential to do more. They'll pretty much bring them all together in a group, and force them to make music together. Being able to speak to other musicians and different ideas, hear other people's stories, all this kind of stuff, really helps every individual artist's creative work moving forward. We made an album together, all 6 of us. It wasn't about the end product. It was more about the process of collaboration, which was fantastic. 


PI: And how did it inspire you in your own creative work after? What did you take away from it (maybe contacts even to work with some of these artists again)? 
MF: Yeah, of course. The big thing is contacts. We all keep in contact with each other and we all back each other's work. So it's very good to keep in contact with Mikael as well as Ben. I play football with Ben's dad sometimes. 

PI: That's so nice. I was curious to talk about “Soften the Blow” more specifically, your track with Mairi Sutherland. I think it's a beautiful track. I listen to it all the time. I noticed that you have a bit more of a passive role on the track, vocally at least, and I thought : did you ever think about music production? Is that something that is of interest to you? Beyond your own music. 
MF: I'm producing for all the tracks on the album. That's one of the big things I want to do with the Alias. And also more written stuff, more about my life and how I view the world. To answer your question, yes, production is definitely an option moving forward. 

PI: And do you have any close friends beyond the Anam Creative friends that you've made, you make music with and that you meet or is it mostly by yourself? 
MF: Yeah absolutely, I had a band,with three mates, we used to work with one person. One of my good mates, Bo, was on guitar. Josh was the drummer. 

PI: And you were the singer? 
MF: No, I was bass (I think to myself, with a scottish accent :“do I need more bass do I need more treble ?” Makes sense now). We had a singer. The guitarist, probably one of the best people in the band, got deported back to America. His visa ran out so he studied for like four years here. He's in America now doing music. 

PI: Okay, well, that's the UK for you. I’m sorry. 

PI: I actually didn't ask you this. How did you learn to make music? Did you just pick up a guitar one day and you're like, I'm going to learn this? 
MF: Yeah, it was probably my family. My dad's always been a big musician. He played the bass and played tracks in the house from a young age. Those different kinds of music were always around us. I had a few lessons at a young age on guitar, but I couldn't read music. So I just played by ear mostly. 

PI: And does your circle support you in that endeavour and kind of push you to take it seriously? 
MF: A little bit, a little bit. My dad pushes me a little bit more than my mother. She's quite based on working, getting a job, income. But she’s happy with it because she'll listen to a track and nod her head and shit. My dad's more “do what makes you happy”. Because he's big on music as well. I think they like seeing me happy. So that's the main thing. 

PI: And how do you feel about people that you know hearing your music, listening to it?
MF: I think it's nice for people I know to listen to my music because if they know me, myself, the music's just like a little extension of myself. It's nothing too serious.

PI: That's funny because I kind of went on it already but my next question was going to be like, to what extent do you take music seriously? Like what parts of it do you take seriously and what parts are you more at ease with just letting go? 
MF: I take it seriously, I want it to sound good, I want the finished product to sound quite professional and like something that I would listen to myself. If it came on in the car, something that I could be like, oh shit, yeah this is actually quite good. Instead of just putting things out there for the sake of it. 

MF: For the letting go part of the music thing, if you know it sounds quite good, then it's okay. The hardest thing is probably getting the video aspect of things around and all the promotion. Making music is easy. All the promotional aspects you need to do behind it, that’s harder.

PI: Do you have non-musical inspirations? Maybe films or architecture or other things that inspire you than music?
MF: I quite like the James Bond series and books by Ian Fleming. I'm reading Moon Record just now. And as for movies… I can sit down and watch a movie. I need to be in the mood. If not, I just usually tune into some of the music that's coming in behind it. There's always fantastic music that's in movies. I like nature, actually. I quite like nature. I go for a nice walk and just breathe in fresh air, looking at the trees. That kind of stuff inspires me.

PI: Do you have nature around you?
MF: Yeah, there's some woods kind of close. I also like going up north and just going for walks up there. 

PI: I was going to ask, because I don't know if it's a cliche question coming from me. I feel like everyone asks this to Scottish artists. How close do you feel to Scotland as a territory? Does it influence your music? Does it influence who you are? 
MF: I'm from Scotland, born and raised in Scotland. I love the Scottish nature. That's one of the big things about it. Scottish music doesn't really align with my kind of music, but I do appreciate it. Mostly, our Scottish culture, things that are more from down south. But I've got one of these hiker jackets on just now, which is probably further up north. 
I'd like to say I'm proud to be Scottish and proud of where I'm from. I love Scotland. I love the fact that we're so close to so many mountains and hills. 

I mention I'm from the French Alps and Marcus responded with a great French accent and questions about skiing. 

PI: Just kind of continuing on to the topic of Scotland. You said earlier that under this new Alias you also want to experiment with different accents. And I was curious what these other accents are.
MF: I mean, well, there's a track that I'm making just now under my current alias. And it's actually based on the... It’s funny we're speaking about France and Paris. I used a sample from a BBC News report, about the Mona Lisa heist. I'm writing a track on that just now. I tried to put a little bit of French in. Just little words that I've kind of picked up over time.

PI: It's so funny you're doing a song about this heist. You're so on the edge of the news right now. Because the Louvre got heisted again.
MF: Oh yeah, yeah. Which is brutal. I wrote a little track about that. I mentioned the Trocadero as well. You listen to it once the album's out.

PI: Do you have any dream collaborations with artists that you like? Maybe Tom Misch, for example? 
MF: Tom Misch, Loyle Carner would be a good one. Kofi Stone, Ezra Collective. Knucks.

PI: Do you have any dream collaborations with dead artists? 
MF: Dead artists… Elvis. D'Angelo's got to be one. That was a recent death. Amy Winehouse too. 

PI: I know they're being compared too much, but would you do a feature with Raye? 
MF: Oh, Raye. Yeah, I love Raye as well. She's alive, thankfully. Olivia Dean's another one. Or Eloise.

PI: Any other dead artists? 
MF: Who's dead? 
PI: Great question. Who's dead? 
MF: D'Angelo or Amy. That would be my two. 

PI: Any projects you haven't made that you would love to make? Like, what's your dream? Imagine you have unlimited funds, everything. 
MF: My dream project would be going somewhere nice. Going to a nice log cabin in Switzerland. And just making a high-quality, crisp video. Make a decent, very well-produced track. Over maybe a good six months. Just make different music, fly out loads of different artists and things like that. Just be in a nice, still-clouded area. 

PI: What kind of music would you make in Switzerland, do you think? In a log cabin? 
MF: Just whatever would come to us, whoever I'm with. If it was with a funk band, then it could be a funk album. If it was with a jazz quartet, it could be... Funk and jazz. Anything. 

PI: Thank you very much. It was lovely to speak to you and good to meet you as well. 
MF: Thanks, super. Well, have a lovely evening and thank you again so much. À bientôt. Bye bye.
